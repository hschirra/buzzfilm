contains BuzzLoginActivity.java and MainActivity.java

When running the app, the user must provide a username and password, each longer than 3 characters.

If trying to login with username "user", the correct password "pass" must be entered in the password field.
Click login and continue to the login screen.
If a password other than "pass" is used with that specific username, the login attempt will fail.
If the entered username or password is less than 3 characters, the login attempt will fail.
If the entered username is longer than 3 characters and not "user" then any valid password will be accepted (as a new user).

Once at the welcome screen, the user can press the logout button to return to the login screen.
